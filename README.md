# TIMS

## Description

Welcome to tims an open-source project build to fill my portfolio with some "extra" project
"tims" stands for "Telegram Interval Message Sender" and it does exactly what its name suggests.
\
\
&nbsp;
When used please follow the [Telegram rules](https://telegram.org/tos) as the software interacts with Telegram server which in return will affect the user using it. If any of those rules are broken your user could be banned from using Telegram permanently hence "tims" won't work at all.
